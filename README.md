# Neighborhood Map Pizza Finder!

Looking for tasty pizza at a location near you? Or maybe you want to search for
pizza some place else?! Either way, the Pizza Finder website will help you in
your search. Let's get started!

## Getting Started

1. Fork or download the project files in this repository. Once downloaded,
you will have everything you need to launch the site. Just find the "index.html"
file and open it in your favorite web browser.

2. Once the website is up, go ahead and set your location. You can do this
automatically by clicking the "Use My Current Location" button at the top, or
you can look an address in the search box and then click "Find Me!".

3. You have been found, nice going! Now we can find some pizza places near you.
Set the search radius in miles to the left and then click "Find Pizza!" and
watch them markers rain from the virtual sky.

4. There you go! Go forth and explore. Click on a marker to find more info about
the found location. If they have a website, we will include the link but not
all places are that "up-with-the-times".

5. Feel free to start your search again, expand your search radius or do a
back flip if you found an awesome new place. (Be careful though, back flips
are dangerous.)
